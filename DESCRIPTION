Description: The 'Gopher' protocol is a 'TCP/IP' application layer protocol
    designed for distributing, searching, and retrieving documents over the 
    Internet. The 'Gopher' protocol was strongly oriented towards a menu-document 
    design and presented an alternative to the World Wide Web in its early 
    stages, but ultimately 'Hypertext Transfer Protocol' ('HTTP') became the 
    dominant protocol. The 'Gopher' ecosystem is often regarded as the effective
    predecessor of the 'World Wide Web'. Tools are provided to interact with
    and retrieve content from 'Gopher' servers.
