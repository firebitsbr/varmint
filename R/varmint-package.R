#' Retrieve Content from and Interact with 'Gopher' Servers
#'
#' The 'Gopher' protocol is a 'TCP/IP' application layer protocol
#' designed for distributing, searching, and retrieving documents over the
#' Internet. The 'Gopher' protocol was strongly oriented towards a menu-document
#' design and presented an alternative to the World Wide Web in its early
#' stages, but ultimately 'Hypertext Transfer Protocol' ('HTTP') became the
#' dominant protocol. The 'Gopher' ecosystem is often regarded as the effective
#' predecessor of the 'World Wide Web'. Tools are provided to interact with
#' and retrieve content from 'Gopher' servers.
